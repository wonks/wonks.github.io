## Abstract

This is the second in a series of lectures introducing how the language of
category theory captures "dependency." In this lecture, we will discuss slice
categories and their structure. (The previous lecture was mostly devoted to
background and examples, so you can still catch up if you missed last week.)

In this lecture series we will start with set-indexed families of sets,
generalize from Set to arbitrary categories, and conclude with category-indexed
families of categories. Topics covered will include bundles and sections, slice
categories, pullbacks, base change, and Grothendieck fibrations.

The categorical prerequisites are minimal: I will assume you know about
categories, functors, terminal objects, and binary products. Knowledge of
dependent type theory is not necessary but may provide additional motivation.
If you already know what a Grothendieck fibration is, you probably won't learn
anything new.

By the end of this series, you will be prepared to understand the categorical
semantics of dependent type theory (such as comprehension categories, display
map categories, and categories with families / natural models), the categorical
gluing approach to logical relations, and why everyone loves pullbacks so much.
