## Abstract

This is the first in a series of lectures introducing how the language of
category theory captures "dependency." We will start with set-indexed families
of sets, generalize from Set to arbitrary categories, and conclude with
category-indexed families of categories. Topics covered will include bundles and
sections, slice categories, pullbacks, base change, and Grothendieck fibrations.

The categorical prerequisites are minimal: I will assume you know about
categories, functors, terminal objects, and binary products. Knowledge of
dependent type theory is not necessary but may provide additional motivation.
If you already know what a Grothendieck fibration is, you probably won't learn
anything new.

By the end of this series, you will be prepared to understand the categorical
semantics of dependent type theory (such as comprehension categories, display
map categories, and categories with families / natural models), "gluing" proofs
of metatheorems, and why everyone loves pullbacks so much.
