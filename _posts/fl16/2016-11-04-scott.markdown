# Abstract

LVish is a Haskell library that claims to offer deterministic
parallelism. However, LVish is only deterministic up to a certain
point, as several parts of the API rely on type class instances to
check for equality, provide an ordering for keys in a map, and other
operations. A rogue user can define "bad" instances that break
invariants that LVish expects to hold true, and consequently, it is
possible to violate determinism through this backdoor.

Our work presents a solution to this problem by integrating LVish code
with Liquid Haskell's refinement type–based proof system. With Liquid
Haskell, we can require users who write type class instances for LVish
to provide proofs that their instances satisfy the properties that we
expect—for instance, that a parallel fold operation is actually
associative. Equipped with this proof assistant, Haskell emerges as
the first practical parallel programming language that also has an
integrated proof system. We will demonstrate some examples of how one
can prove simple properties in this system, and will examine what it
takes to fully verify some LVish applications.
