# Abstract

We present a straightforward, call-by-value embedding of a small logic
programming language with a simple complete search. We construct the
entire language in 54 lines of Racket---half of which implement
unification. We then layer over it, in 43 lines, a reconstruction of
an existing logic programming language, miniKanren, and attest to our
implementation's pedagogical value. Evidence suggests our combination
of expressiveness, concision, and elegance is compelling: since
microKanren's release, it has spawned over 50 embeddings in over two
dozen host languages, including Go, Haskell, Prolog and Smalltalk.
