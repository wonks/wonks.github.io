## Abstract

To enable compositional reasoning for processes with shared memory, one has to
understand how the properties of the behaviour of single processes can be
composed into properties of the system that result from letting the processes
interact via the shared memory. One option for handling this composition is
so-called separation logic, which allows reasoning about memory regions and,
thereby, about local views of single processes. This talk investigates
compositional reasoning for interacting processes with shared memory. It
proposes leveraging sheaves to amalgamate local views of processes into a
cohesive specification of the global process, offering a more abstract approach
to reasoning. Through a category-theoretic framework, it provides semantics for
process interaction via shared memory and establishes connections between
sheaves and the semantics of the standard pointer model of separation logic. The
talk concludes with an outline of my ongoing research, aiming to refine local
reasoning about programs within this framework and extend its applicability to
extensions of separation logic.
