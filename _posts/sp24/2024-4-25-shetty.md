## Abstract

[Malt](https://github.com/themetaschemer/malt) is a minimalist deep learning
library that is designed to support the book The Little Learner: A Straight Line
to Deep Learning, by Daniel P. Friedman and Anurag Mendhekar. Tensors are the
main data structures over which the functions provided by Malt operate on. I
will be talking about the alternate ways in which tensors are implemented in
Malt.
