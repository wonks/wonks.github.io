**The Midwest Programming Languages Summit is meeting on
December 1st, 2017 at Indiana University.**

The Midwest PL Summit is an informal workshop to foster the exchange
of ideas and to promote collaboration among faculty and students in
the Greater Midwest area. Anyone interested in programming languages
and compilers — including applications to areas such as systems,
software engineering, and human-computer interaction — is welcome to
attend. Our aim is to have a broad selection of talks and posters
about ongoing research and any other topics that may be of interest to
the PL community. There will be no formal proceedings, but abstracts
and slides will be distributed on the web after the workshop.
