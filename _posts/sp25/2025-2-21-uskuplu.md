## Abstract

This talk explores the challenges of representing and manipulating variable
bindings in formal verification and programming language theory, focusing on the
formalization of the simply typed lambda calculus (STLC) in Lean using the
locally nameless representation with cofinite quantification. This approach
combines the readability of named representations with the automation-friendly
properties of de Bruijn indices while simplifying the handling of bound
variables, particularly in inductive proofs. We discuss the benefits of cofinite
quantification, which enables strong induction principles. The talk covers the
implementation of confluence and strong normalization proofs, highlighting the
necessity of simultaneous and multivariable substitution. The talk is aimed at
those interested in proof assistants, type theory, and automated reasoning,
offering insights into the advantages and practical applications of this
approach in Lean.
